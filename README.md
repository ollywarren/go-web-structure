# Go Lang Web Structure
## My Starter Structure for Go Web Projects.

This is my starter project for all my Go Web Applications. At present this is work in progress as I'm still learning Go and using Go to build we applications. Coming from a Laravel PHP background my aim is to try and keep with a familiar structure I'm used to.

This will likely change over tme as I build more Go Web Applications and become more familair with the Language.

Feel free to use for your onw projects.
